      My experience in class has been nothing short of great. I had a first
      class seat in learning HTML & CSS that looked impossible before now. I
      learned how to navigate VScode environment, create new files, write HTML &
      CSS codes, preview them live, among many others.

      One of the greatest things about reading books is that it allows you to
      experience different worlds, perspectives, and ideas without ever leaving
      your seat. Whether it's fiction transporting you to fantastical lands or
      nonfiction expanding your knowledge, books have the power to broaden your
      mind, enhance your creativity, and improve your understanding of people
      and the world.

    <h3>singing</h3>

      When you sing, your brain releases endorphins and oxytocin, which help
      reduce stress and make you feel happier. It’s like a built-in therapy
      session! Plus, singing improves lung function, strengthens your voice, and
      even enhances your confidence—whether you're singing in the shower or on a
      stage.
    </p>
    <h3>Playing Games</h3>

    <p>
      Whether it’s video games, board games, or sports, games boost
      problem-solving abilities, improve reflexes, and enhance strategic
      thinking. Plus, they bring people together—whether you're competing with
      friends, working as a team, or just having a good laugh.
